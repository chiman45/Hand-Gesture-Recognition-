Hand Gesture Recognition Software
Overview
This project is a Python-based hand gesture recognition software that allows users to control various aspects of their computer system using hand gestures. The system detects hand gestures via a camera feed and translates them into actions like controlling the mouse cursor, minimizing windows, adjusting volume, and more.

Features
Control Mouse Cursor: Move the mouse pointer by extending your index finger.
Minimize Current Window: Close all fingers into a fist to minimize the current window.
Restore Current Window: Show three fingers (index, middle, and ring) to restore a minimized window.
Click Action: Use the victory symbol (index and middle fingers extended and joined) to click.
Increase Volume: Show a thumbs-up gesture to increase the system volume.
Decrease Volume: Make an "Okay" gesture (thumb and index finger forming a circle) to decrease the system volume.
Initiate Virtual Keyboard: Raise four fingers to open the virtual keyboard.
Deactivate Virtual Keyboard: Raise four fingers again to close the virtual keyboard.
Scroll Up: Show five fingers up to scroll the screen up.
Scroll Down: Make a "U" gesture (index and ring fingers extended, others closed) to scroll down.
How It Works
The software uses computer vision techniques, leveraging libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and track hand movements. The gestures are interpreted using machine learning models or predefined rules, and corresponding system actions are triggered.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
MediaPipe
PyAutoGUI (for controlling mouse and keyboard)
Numpy
Install all the required dependencies using:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gesture-recognition.git
cd hand-gesture-recognition
Install the dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main script:

css
Copy code
python main.py
Usage
Ensure that your camera is working.
Launch the script, and you will see a live feed where the gestures are detected.
Perform the specified gestures, and the software will execute the corresponding actions on your computer.
Gesture Actions:
Gesture	Action
Index finger extended:	Control mouse cursor
Fist (all fingers closed):	Minimize current window
Three fingers up:	Restore minimized window
Victory symbol (joined fingers):	Click
Thumbs up:	Increase volume
Okay signal:	Decrease volume
Four fingers up:	Open virtual keyboard
Four fingers up (again)	:Close virtual keyboard
Five fingers up	:Scroll up
U symbol	:Scroll down
